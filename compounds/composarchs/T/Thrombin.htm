<p>In human adults, the normal blood level of antithrombin activity has been measured to be around 1.1 units/mL.

<p>Thrombin bound to thrombomodulin activates protein C, an inhibitor of the coagulation cascade. The activation of protein C is greatly enhanced following the binding of thrombin to thrombomodulin, an integral membrane protein expressed by endothelial cells. Activated protein C inactivates factors Va and VIIIa. Binding of activated protein C to protein S leads to a modest increase in its activity. Thrombin is also inactivated by antithrombin, a serine protease inhibitor.</p>

<p>The molecular weight of prothrombin is approximately 72,000 Da. The catalytic domain is released from prothrombin fragment 1.2 to create the active enzyme thrombin, which has a molecular weight of 36,000 Da. Structurally, it is a member of the large PA clan of proteases.</p>

<p>Prothrombin is composed of four domains; an N-terminal Gla domain, two kringle domains and a C-terminal <a href="Trypsin.htm" tppabs="https://ptable.com/wiki/compounds/A/Trypsin" title="Trypsin">trypsin</a>-like serine protease domain.
Factor Xa with factor V as a cofactor leads to cleavage of the Gla and two Kringle domains (forming together a fragment called fragment 1.2) and leave thrombin, consisting solely of the serine protease domain.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 16;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[16]</span></a></span></p>

<p>As is the case for all serine proteases, <a href="Thrombin.htm" tppabs="https://ptable.com/wiki/compounds/A/Prothrombin" title="Prothrombin" class="mw-redirect">prothrombin</a> is converted to active thrombin by proteolysis of an internal peptide bond, exposing a new N-terminal Ile-NH3. The historic model of activation of serine proteases involves insertion of this newly formed N-terminus of the heavy chain into the β-barrel promoting the correct conformation of the catalytic residues.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 17;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[17]</span></a></span> Contrary to crystal structures of active thrombin, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry studies indicate that this N-terminal Ile-NH3 does not become inserted into the β-barrel in the apo form of thrombin. However, binding of the active fragment of thrombomodulin appears to allosterically promote the active conformation of thrombin by inserting this N-terminal region.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 18;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[18]</span></a></span></p>

<p>There are an estimated 30 people in the world that have been diagnosed with the congenital form of Factor II deficiency,<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-pmid7792730_19-0"><a href="#cite_note-pmid7792730-19" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 19;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[19]</span></a></span> which should not be confused with the prothrombin G20210A mutation, which is also called the factor II mutation.

<p>Prothrombin G20210A is not usually accompanied by other factor mutations (i.e., the most common is factor V Leiden). The gene may be inherited heterozygous (1 pair), or much more rarely, homozygous (2 pairs), and is not related to gender or blood type. Homozygous mutations increase the risk of thrombosis more than heterozygous mutations, but the relative increased risk is not well documented. Other potential risks for thrombosis, such as oral contraceptives may be additive. The previously reported relationship of inflammatory bowel disease (i.e., Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) and prothrombin G20210A or factor V Leiden mutation have been contradicted by research.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-21"><a href="#cite_note-21" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 21;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[21]</span></a></span></p>

<p>Activation of prothrombin is crucial in physiological and pathological coagulation. Various rare diseases involving prothrombin have been described (e.g., hypoprothrombinemia). Anti-prothrombin <a href="Antibody.htm" tppabs="https://ptable.com/wiki/compounds/A/Antibody" title="Antibody">antibodies</a> in autoimmune disease may be a factor in the formation of the lupus anticoagulant (also known as antiphospholipid syndrome). Hyperprothrombinemia can be caused by the G20210A mutation.</p>

<p>Thrombin, a potent vasoconstrictor and mitogen, is implicated as a major factor in vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. Blood from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm clots around a cerebral artery, releasing thrombin. This can induce an acute and prolonged narrowing of the blood vessel, potentially resulting in cerebral ischemia and infarction (stroke).</p>

<p>Beyond its key role in the dynamic process of thrombus formation, thrombin has a pronounced pro-inflammatory character, which may influence the onset and progression of atherosclerosis. Acting via its specific cell membrane receptors (protease activated receptors: PAR-1, PAR-3 and PAR-4), which are abundantly expressed in all arterial vessel wall constituents, thrombin has the potential to exert pro-atherogenic actions such as inflammation, leukocyte recruitment into the atherosclerotic plaque, enhanced oxidative stress, migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, apoptosis and angiogenesis.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-pmid19228706_22-0"><a href="#cite_note-pmid19228706-22" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 22;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[22]</span></a></span><span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-pmid20697022_23-0"><a href="#cite_note-pmid20697022-23" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 23;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[23]</span></a></span><span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-pmid21542745_24-0"><a href="#cite_note-pmid21542745-24" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 24;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[24]</span></a></span></p>

<p>Thrombin is implicated in the physiology of blood clots. Its presence indicates the existence of a clot. In 2013 a system for detecting the presence of thrombin was developed in mice. It combines peptide-coated iron oxide attached to "reporter chemicals". When a peptide binds to a thrombin molecule, the report is released and appears in the urine where it can be detected. Human testing has not been conducted.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 25;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[25]</span></a></span></p>

<p>Due to its high proteolytic specificity, thrombin is a valuable biochemical tool. The thrombin cleavage site (Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser) is commonly included in linker regions of recombinant fusion protein constructs. Following purification of the fusion protein, thrombin can be used to selectively cleave between the <a href="Arginine.htm" tppabs="https://ptable.com/wiki/compounds/A/Arginine" title="Arginine">arginine</a> and <a href="Glycine.htm" tppabs="https://ptable.com/wiki/compounds/A/Glycine" title="Glycine">glycine</a> residues of the cleavage site, effectively removing the purification tag from the protein of interest with a high degree of specificity.</p>

<p>Prothrombin complex concentrate and fresh frozen plasma are prothrombin-rich coagulation factor preparations that can be used to correct deficiencies (usually due to medication) of prothrombin. Indications include intractable bleeding due to <a href="Warfarin.htm" tppabs="https://ptable.com/wiki/compounds/A/Warfarin" title="Warfarin">warfarin</a>.</p>

<p>Manipulation of prothrombin is central to the mode of action of most anticoagulants. <a href="Warfarin.htm" tppabs="https://ptable.com/wiki/compounds/A/Warfarin" title="Warfarin">Warfarin</a> and related drugs inhibit <a href="Vitamin_K.htm" tppabs="https://ptable.com/wiki/compounds/A/Vitamin_K" title="Vitamin K">vitamin K</a>-dependent carboxylation of several coagulation factors, including prothrombin. <a href="Heparin.htm" tppabs="https://ptable.com/wiki/compounds/A/Heparin" title="Heparin">Heparin</a> increases the affinity of antithrombin to thrombin (as well as factor Xa). The direct thrombin inhibitors, a newer class of medication, directly inhibit thrombin by binding to its active site.</p>

<p>Recombinant thrombin is available as a powder for reconstitution into aqueous solution. It can be applied topically during surgery, as an aid to hemostasis. It can be useful for controlling minor bleeding from capillaries and small venules, but ineffective and not indicated for massive or brisk arterial bleeding.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-pmid17660072_26-0"><a href="#cite_note-pmid17660072-26" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 26;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[26]</span></a></span><span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-pmid19651065_27-0"><a href="#cite_note-pmid19651065-27" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 27;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[27]</span></a></span><span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-pmid19349898_28-0"><a href="#cite_note-pmid19349898-28" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 28;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[28]</span></a></span></p>
