<p>Albumin transports hormones, fatty acids, and other compounds, buffers pH, and maintains oncotic pressure, among other functions.</p>

<p>Albumin is synthesized in the liver as preproalbumin, which has an N-terminal peptide that is removed before the nascent protein is released from the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The product, proalbumin, is in turn cleaved in the Golgi vesicles to produce the secreted albumin.</p>

<p>The reference range for albumin concentrations in serum is approximately 35–50<span>&nbsp;</span>g/L (3.5–5.0<span>&nbsp;</span>g/dL).<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-Pathology_Harmony_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-Pathology_Harmony-5" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 5;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[5]</span></a></span>  It has a serum half-life of approximately 21 days.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-Medscape_Reference_2019_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-Medscape_Reference_2019-6" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 6;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[6]</span></a></span> It has a molecular mass of 66.5<span>&nbsp;</span>kDa.</p>

<p>The gene for albumin is located on chromosome 4 in locus 4q13.3 and mutations in this gene can result in anomalous proteins. The human albumin gene is 16,961 nucleotides long from the putative 'cap' site to the first poly(A) addition site. It is split into 15 exons that are symmetrically placed within the 3 domains thought to have arisen by triplication of a single primordial domain.</p>

<p>The normal range of human serum albumin in adults (&gt; 3 y.o.) is 3.5–5.0<span>&nbsp;</span> g/dL (35–50<span>&nbsp;</span>g/L). For children less than three years of age, the normal range is broader, 2.9–5.5 g/dL.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 9;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[9]</span></a></span></p>

<p>Low albumin (hypoalbuminemia) may be caused by liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, burns, protein-losing enteropathy, malabsorption, malnutrition, late pregnancy, artefact, genetic variations and malignancy.</p>

<p>High albumin (<a href="Human_serum_albumin.htm" tppabs="https://ptable.com/wiki/compounds/A/Hyperalbuminemia" title="Hyperalbuminemia" class="mw-redirect">hyperalbuminemia</a>) is almost always caused by dehydration. In some cases of retinol (<a href="Vitamin_A.htm" tppabs="https://ptable.com/wiki/compounds/A/Vitamin_A" title="Vitamin A">Vitamin A</a>) deficiency, the albumin level can be elevated to high-normal values (e.g., 4.9 g/dL).  This is because retinol causes cells to swell with water (this is also the reason too much Vitamin A is toxic).<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 10;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[10]</span></a></span>
This swelling also likely occurs during treatment with 13-cis retinoic acid (<a href="Isotretinoin.htm" tppabs="https://ptable.com/wiki/compounds/A/Isotretinoin" title="Isotretinoin">isotretnoin</a>), a pharmaceutical for treating severe acne, amongst other conditions.

<p>Human albumin solution (HSA) is available for medical use, usually at concentrations of 5–25%.</p>

<p>Human albumin is often used to replace lost fluid and help restore blood volume in trauma, burns and surgery patients. There is no strong medical evidence that albumin administration (compared to saline) saves lives for people who have hypovolaemia or for those who are critically ill due to burns or hypoalbuminaemia.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-Roberts_2011_16-0"><a href="#cite_note-Roberts_2011-16" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 16;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[16]</span></a></span> It is also not known if there are people who are critically ill that may benefit from albumin.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-Roberts_2011_16-1"><a href="#cite_note-Roberts_2011-16" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 16;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[16]</span></a></span> Therefore, the Cochrane Collaboration recommends that it should not be used, except in clinical trials.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-Coc11_17-0"><a href="#cite_note-Coc11-17" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 17;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[17]</span></a></span></p>

<p>In acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV), albumin is sometimes used as a surfactant.  ADV has been proposed as a cancer treatment by means of <span class="new">occlusion therapy</span>.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 18;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[18]</span></a></span></p>

<p>Human serum albumin may be used to potentially reverse drug/chemical toxicity by binding to free drug/agent.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 19;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[19]</span></a></span></p>

<p>Human albumin may also be used in treatment of decompensated cirrhosis.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 20;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[20]</span></a></span></p>

<p>It has not been shown to give better results than other fluids when used simply to replace volume, but is frequently used in conditions where loss of albumin is a major problem, such as liver disease with ascites.</p>

<p>Moreover, the glycation can result in the formation of Advanced Glycation End-Products (AGE), which result in abnormal biological effects. Accumulation of AGEs leads to tissue damage via alteration of the structures and functions of tissue proteins, stimulation of cellular responses, through receptors specific for AGE-proteins, and generation of reactive oxygen intermediates. AGEs also react with DNA, thus causing mutations and DNA transposition. Thermal processing of proteins and carbohydrates brings major changes in allergenicity. AGEs are antigenic and represent many of the important neoantigens found in cooked or stored foods.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-pmid11916310_29-0"><a href="#cite_note-pmid11916310-29" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 29;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[29]</span></a></span> They also interfere with the normal product of nitric oxide in cells.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-pmid10679490_30-0"><a href="#cite_note-pmid10679490-30" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 30;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[30]</span></a></span></p>
