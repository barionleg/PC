<p>During 1889, Thomas Edison had business interests in many electricity-related companies, including Edison Lamp Company, a lamp manufacturer in East Newark, New Jersey; Edison Machine Works, a manufacturer of dynamos and large electric motors in Schenectady, New York; Bergmann &amp; Company, a manufacturer of electric lighting fixtures, sockets, and other electric lighting devices; and <i>Edison Electric Light Company</i>, the patent-holding company and the financial arm backed by J. P. Morgan and the Vanderbilt family for Edison's lighting experiments.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 10;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[10]</span></a></span></p>

<p>In 1889, Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co., a company founded by J.P. Morgan and Anthony J. Drexel, financed Edison's research and helped merge those companies under one corporation to form Edison General Electric Company, which was incorporated in New York on April 24, 1889. The new company also acquired Sprague Electric Railway &amp; Motor Company in the same year.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 11;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[11]</span></a></span><span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-jpmorgan_12-0"><a href="#cite_note-jpmorgan-12" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 12;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[12]</span></a></span></p>

<p>In 1880, Gerald Waldo Hart formed the American Electric Company of New Britain, Connecticut, which merged a few years later with Thomson-Houston Electric Company, led by Charles Coffin. In 1887, Hart left to become superintendent of the Edison Electric Company of Kansas City, Missouri.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 13;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[13]</span></a></span> General Electric was formed through the 1892 merger of Edison General Electric Company of Schenectady, New York, and Thomson-Houston Electric Company of Lynn, Massachusetts, with the support of Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-jpmorgan_12-1"><a href="#cite_note-jpmorgan-12" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 12;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[12]</span></a></span> Both plants continue to operate under the GE banner to this day.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 14;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[14]</span></a></span> The company was incorporated in New York, with the Schenectady plant used as headquarters for many years thereafter.

<p>In 1893 General Electric bought the business of Rudolf Eickemeyer in Yonkers, New York, along with all of its patents and designs. One of the employees was Charles Proteus Steinmetz. Only recently arrived in the United States, Steinmetz was already publishing in the field of magnetic hysteresis and had earned worldwide professional recognition.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-IEEEPER_(1996)_16-0"><a href="#cite_note-IEEEPER_(1996)-16" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 16;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[16]</span></a></span>  Led by Steinmetz, Eickemeyer's firm had developed transformers for use in the transmission of electrical power among many other mechanical and electrical devices. Steinmetz quickly became known as the engineering wizard in GE's engineering community.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-IEEEPER_(1996)_16-1"><a href="#cite_note-IEEEPER_(1996)-16" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 16;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[16]</span></a></span></p>

<p>Owen D. Young, through GE, founded the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in 1919, after purchasing the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America. He aimed to expand international radio communications. GE used RCA as its retail arm for radio sales.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 20;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[20]</span></a></span> In 1926, RCA co-founded the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), which built two radio broadcasting networks.

The sound was broadcast on GE's WGY (AM).</p>

<p>Experimental television station W2XAD evolved into the station WRGB which, along with WGY and WGFM (now WRVE), was owned and operated by General Electric until 1983.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 23;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[23]</span></a></span></p>

<p>Led by Sanford Alexander Moss, GE moved into the new field of aircraft turbo superchargers. This technology also led to the development of industrial gas turbine engines used for power production. <span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 24;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[24]</span></a></span>   GE introduced the first set of superchargers during World War I, and continued to develop them during the interwar period. Superchargers became indispensable in the years immediately prior to World War II. GE supplied 300,000 turbo superchargers for use in fighter and bomber engines. This work led the U.S. Army Air Corps to select GE to develop the nation's first jet engine during the war.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 25;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[25]</span></a></span> This experience, in turn, made GE a natural selection to develop the Whittle W.1 jet engine that was demonstrated in the United States in 1941.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 26;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[26]</span></a></span> GE was ranked ninth among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-27"><a href="#cite_note-27" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 27;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[27]</span></a></span> Although, their early work with Whittle's designs was later handed to Allison Engine Company. GE Aviation then emerged as one of the world's largest engine manufacturers, bypassing the British company, Rolls-Royce plc.</p>

<p>Some consumers boycotted GE light bulbs, refrigerators and other products during the 1980s and 1990s. The purpose of the boycott was to protest against GE's role in nuclear weapons production.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-28"><a href="#cite_note-28" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 28;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[28]</span></a></span></p>

<p>In 2002, GE acquired the wind power assets of Enron during its bankruptcy proceedings.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-Business_Wire_29-0"><a href="#cite_note-Business_Wire-29" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 29;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[29]</span></a></span> Enron Wind was the only surviving U.S. manufacturer of large wind turbines at the time, and GE increased engineering and supplies for the Wind Division and doubled the annual sales to $1.2<span>&nbsp;</span>billion in 2003.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-ieGE_30-0"><a href="#cite_note-ieGE-30" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 30;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[30]</span></a></span> It acquired ScanWind in 2009.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-31"><a href="#cite_note-31" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 31;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[31]</span></a></span><span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-32"><a href="#cite_note-32" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 32;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[32]</span></a></span></p>

<p>In 2018, GE Power garnered press attention when a model 7HA gas turbine in Texas was shut down for two months due to the break of a turbine blade.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-33"><a href="#cite_note-33" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 33;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[33]</span></a></span> This model uses similar blade technology to GE's newest and most efficient model, the 9HA. After the break, GE developed new protective coatings and heat treatment methods. Gas turbines represent a significant portion of GE Power's revenue, and also represent a significant portion of the power generation fleet of several utility companies in the United States. Chubu Electric of Japan and Ã‰lectricitÃ© de France also had units that were impacted. Initially, GE did not realize the turbine blade issue of the 9FB unit would impact the new HA units.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-34"><a href="#cite_note-34" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 34;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[34]</span></a></span></p>

<p>GE was one of the eight major computer companies of the 1960s along with IBM, Burroughs, NCR, Control Data Corporation, Honeywell, RCA and UNIVAC.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-Guston_35-0"><a href="#cite_note-Guston-35" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 35;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[35]</span></a></span> GE had a line of general purpose and special purpose computers, including the GE 200, GE 400, and GE 600 series general purpose computers,<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-Guston_35-1"><a href="#cite_note-Guston-35" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 35;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[35]</span></a></span> the GE 4010, GE 4020, and GE 4060 real-time process control computers, and the DATANET-30 and Datanet 355 message switching computers (DATANET-30 and 355 were also used as front end processors for GE mainframe computers). A Datanet 500 computer was designed, but never sold.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-36"><a href="#cite_note-36" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 36;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[36]</span></a></span></p>

<p>In 1962, GE started developing its GECOS (later renamed GCOS) operating system, originally for batch processing, but later extended to timesharing and transaction processing. Versions of GCOS are still in use today. From 1964 to 1969, GE and Bell Laboratories (which soon dropped out) joined with MIT to develop the Multics operating system on the GE 645 mainframe computer. The project took longer than expected and was not a major commercial success, but it demonstrated concepts such as single level store, dynamic linking, hierarchical file system, and ring-oriented security. Active development of Multics continued until 1985.</p>

<p>GE got into computer manufacturing because in the 1950s they were the largest user of computers outside the United States federal government,<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-Guston_35-2"><a href="#cite_note-Guston-35" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 35;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[35]</span></a></span> aside from being the first business in the world to own a computer. Its major appliance manufacturing plant "Appliance Park" was the first non-governmental site to host one.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-37"><a href="#cite_note-37" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 37;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[37]</span></a></span> However, in 1970, GE sold its computer division to Honeywell, exiting the computer manufacturing industry,<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-Guston_35-3"><a href="#cite_note-Guston-35" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 35;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[35]</span></a></span> though it retained its timesharing operations for some years afterwards. GE was a major provider of computer time-sharing services, through General Electric Information Services (GEIS, now GXS), offering online computing services that included GEnie.</p>

<p>In 2000, when United Technologies Corp. planned to buy Honeywell, GE made a counter-offer that was approved by Honeywell.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-38"><a href="#cite_note-38" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 38;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[38]</span></a></span> On July 3, 2001, the European Union issued a statement that "prohibit the proposed acquisition by General Electric Co. of Honeywell Inc.".<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-EU-GE-Honeywell_39-0"><a href="#cite_note-EU-GE-Honeywell-39" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 39;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[39]</span></a></span> The reasons given were it "would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets and that the remedies proposed by GE were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of Honeywell".<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-EU-GE-Honeywell_39-1"><a href="#cite_note-EU-GE-Honeywell-39" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 39;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[39]</span></a></span></p>

<p>On June 27, 2014, GE partnered with collaborative design company Quirky to announce its connected LED bulb called Link.

<p>The changes included a new corporate color palette, small modifications to the GE logo, a new customized font (GE Inspira) and a new slogan, "Imagination at work", composed by David Lucas, to replace the slogan "We Bring Good Things to Life" used since 1979.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-slogan_155-0"><a href="#cite_note-slogan-155" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 155;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[155]</span></a></span> The standard requires many headlines to be lowercased and adds visual "white space" to documents and advertising.

<li>GE Capital</li>
<li>GE Digital</li>
<li>GE Healthcare</li>

<p>The former GE Transportation division merged with Wabtec on February 25, 2019, leaving GE with a 24.9% holding in Wabtec.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-159"><a href="#cite_note-159" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 159;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[159]</span></a></span></p>

<p>The former GE Appliances and Lighting segment was dissolved in 2014 when GE's appliance division was attempted to be sold to Electrolux for $5.4 billion, but eventually sold it to Haier in June 2016 due to antitrust filing against Electrolux. GE Lighting (consumer lighting) and the newly created Current, powered by GE, which deals in commercial LED, solar, EV, and energy storage, became stand-alone businesses within the company,<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-cnetHaier_160-0"><a href="#cite_note-cnetHaier-160" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 160;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[160]</span></a></span> until the sale of the later to American Industrial Partners in April 2019<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-161"><a href="#cite_note-161" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 161;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[161]</span></a></span></p>

<p>Through these businesses, GE participates in markets that include the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity (e.g. nuclear, gas and solar), lighting, industrial automation, medical imaging equipment, motors, railway locomotives, aircraft jet engines, and aviation services. Through GE Commercial Finance, GE Consumer Finance, GE Equipment Services, and GE Insurance it offers a range of financial services.

<p>Even though the first wave of conglomerates (such as ITT Corporation, Ling-Temco-Vought, Tenneco, etc.) fell by the wayside by the mid-1980s, in the late 1990s, another wave (consisting of Westinghouse, Tyco, and others) tried and failed to emulate GE's success.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-165"><a href="#cite_note-165" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 165;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[165]</span></a></span></p>

<p>On May 4, 2008, it was announced that GE would auction off its appliances business for an expected sale of $5â€“8<span>&nbsp;</span>billion.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-166"><a href="#cite_note-166" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 166;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[166]</span></a></span> However, this plan fell through as a result of the recession.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-167"><a href="#cite_note-167" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 167;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[167]</span></a></span></p>

<p>GE has a history of some of its activities giving rise to large-scale air and water pollution. Based on data from 2000,<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-170"><a href="#cite_note-170" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 170;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[170]</span></a></span> researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute listed the corporation as the fourth-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, with more than 4.4<span>&nbsp;</span>million pounds per year (2,000 tons) of toxic chemicals released into the air.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-171"><a href="#cite_note-171" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 171;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[171]</span></a></span> GE has also been implicated in the creation of toxic waste. According to EPA documents, only the United States Government, Honeywell, and Chevron Corporation are responsible for producing more Superfund toxic waste sites.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-172"><a href="#cite_note-172" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 172;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[172]</span></a></span></p>

<p>In 1983, New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York to compel GE to pay for the clean-up of what was claimed to be more than 100,000 tons of chemicals dumped from their plant in Waterford, New York.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-173"><a href="#cite_note-173" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 173;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[173]</span></a></span> In 1999, the company agreed to pay a $250<span>&nbsp;</span>million settlement in connection with claims it polluted the Housatonic River (Pittsfield, Massachusetts) and other sites with <a href="Polychlorinated_biphenyl.htm" tppabs="https://ptable.com/wiki/compounds/A/Polychlorinated_biphenyl" title="Polychlorinated biphenyl">polychlorinated biphenyls</a> (PCBs) and other hazardous substances.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-174"><a href="#cite_note-174" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 174;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[174]</span></a></span></p>

<p>In 2003, acting on concerns that the plan proposed by GE did not "provide for adequate protection of public health and the environment," the United States Environmental Protection Agency issued a unilateral administrative order for the company to "address cleanup at the GE site" in Rome, Georgia, also contaminated with PCBs.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-175"><a href="#cite_note-175" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 175;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[175]</span></a></span></p>

<p>The nuclear reactors involved in the 2011 crisis at Fukushima I in Japan were GE designs,<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-176"><a href="#cite_note-176" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 176;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[176]</span></a></span> and the architectural designs were done by Ebasco,<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-177"><a href="#cite_note-177" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 177;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[177]</span></a></span> formerly owned by GE.

Musician Pete Seeger founded the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater and the Clearwater Festival to draw attention to the problem. In 1983, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declared a 200-mile (320<span>&nbsp;</span>km) stretch of the river, from Hudson Falls to New York City, to be a Superfund site requiring cleanup.

<p>In May 2005, GE announced the launch of a program called "Ecomagination", intended, in the words of CEO Jeff Immelt, "to develop tomorrow's solutions such as solar energy, hybrid locomotives, fuel cells, lower-emission aircraft engines, lighter and stronger durable materials, efficient lighting, and water purification technology".<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-194"><a href="#cite_note-194" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 194;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[194]</span></a></span> The announcement prompted an op-ed piece in <i>The New York Times</i> to observe that, "while General Electric's increased emphasis on clean technology will probably result in improved products and benefit its bottom line, Mr. Immelt's credibility as a spokesman on national environmental policy is fatally flawed because of his company's intransigence in cleaning up its own toxic legacy."<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-195"><a href="#cite_note-195" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 195;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[195]</span></a></span></p>

<p>GE has said that it will invest $1.4<span>&nbsp;</span>billion in clean technology research and development in 2008 as part of its Ecomagination initiative. As of October 2008, the scheme had resulted in 70 green products being brought to market, ranging from halogen lamps to biogas engines. In 2007, GE raised the annual revenue target for its Ecomagination initiative from $20<span>&nbsp;</span>billion in 2010 to $25<span>&nbsp;</span>billion following positive market response to its new product lines.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-196"><a href="#cite_note-196" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 196;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[196]</span></a></span> In 2010, GE continued to raise its investment by adding $10<span>&nbsp;</span>billion into Ecomagination over the next five years.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-197"><a href="#cite_note-197" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 197;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[197]</span></a></span></p>

<p>GE Energy's renewable energy business has expanded greatly, to keep up with growing U.S. and global demand for clean energy.

We are evaluating the effect of the standard on our consolidated financial statements and anticipate that its adoption will significantly change the accounting for measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities. The ASU requires cash flow assumptions used in the measurement of various insurance liabilities to be reviewed at least annually and updated if actual experience or other evidence indicates previous assumptions need to be revised with any required changes recorded in earnings. The discount rate, equivalent to the upper-medium grade (i.e., single A) fixed-income instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristics of the liability, is required to be updated in each reporting period with changes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. In measuring the insurance liabilities, contracts shall not be grouped together from different issue years.

Retrieved <span class="nowrap">August 20,</span> 2019</span>. <q>As previously announced, we plan an orderly separation of our ownership interest in BHGE over time. In November 2018, BHGE completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold 101.2 million shares of BHGE Class A common stock. BHGE also repurchased 65.0 million BHGE LLC units from GE. As a result, our economic interest in BHGE reduced from 62.5% to 50.4% and we recognized a loss of $2,169 million ($1,696 million after-tax), which decreased the Other Capital component of shareowners' equity. Sale of Class A common stock resulted in an increase in noncontrolling interests of $4,214 million. Any reduction in our ownership interest below 50% will result in us losing control of BHGE. At that point, we would de-consolidate our Oil &amp; Gas segment, recognize any remaining interest at fair value and recognize any difference between carrying value and fair value of our interest in earnings. Depending on the form and timing of our separation, and if BHGEâ€™s stock price remains below our current carrying value, we may recognize a significant loss in earnings. Based on BHGE's share price on January 31, 2019, of $23.57 per share, the incremental loss upon deconsolidation by a sale of our interest would be approximately $8,400 million.</q></cite></span></li><li id="cite_note-109"> <span id="mw-reference-text-cite_note-109" class="mw-reference-text"><cite class="citation web cs1"><a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://www.ge.com/reports/follow-up-from-last-weeks-note/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport VLX, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://www.ge.com/reports/follow-up-from-last-weeks-note/'" tppabs="https://www.ge.com/reports/follow-up-from-last-weeks-note/" class="external text external">"follow-up-from-last-weeks-note"</a>. <i>GE.com</i>.
