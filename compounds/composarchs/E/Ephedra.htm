<p>A wide variety of alkaloid and non-alkaloid compounds have been identified in various species of <i>ephedra</i>.  Of the six ephedrine-type ingredients found in <i>ephedra</i> (at concentrations of 0.02-3.4%), the most common are <a href="Ephedrine.htm" tppabs="https://ptable.com/wiki/compounds/A/Ephedrine" title="Ephedrine">ephedrine</a> and <a href="Pseudoephedrine.htm" tppabs="https://ptable.com/wiki/compounds/A/Pseudoephedrine" title="Pseudoephedrine">pseudoephedrine</a>,<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 12;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[12]</span></a></span> which are the sources of its stimulant and thermogenic effects.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-Abourashed_2003_3-1"><a href="#cite_note-Abourashed_2003-3" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 3;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[3]</span></a></span> These compounds stimulate the brain, increase heart rate, constrict blood vessels (increasing blood pressure), and expand bronchial tubes (making breathing easier).

<p>Escalating concerns regarding the safety of ephedra supplements led the FDA to ban the sale of supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids (specifically ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norephedrine, and methylephedrine) in the United States in 2004. This ban was challenged by supplement manufacturers and initially overturned, but ultimately upheld.</p>

<p>In 1997, in response to mounting concern over serious side effects of ephedra, the FDA proposed a ban on products containing 8<span>&nbsp;</span>mg or more of ephedrine alkaloids and stricter labeling of low-dose ephedra supplements. The FDA also proposed that ephedra labels be required to disclose the health risks of ephedra, such as heart attack, stroke, and death.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 25;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[25]</span></a></span></p>

<p>In response, the supplement industry created a public relations group, the Ephedra Education Council, to oppose the changes, and commissioned a scientific review by a private consulting firm, which reported that ephedra was safe.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-consumerreports_26-0"><a href="#cite_note-consumerreports-26" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 26;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[26]</span></a></span> The Ephedra Education Council also attempted to block publication of a study confirming wide discrepancies between the labeled potency of supplements and the actual amount of ephedra in the product.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-salon_20-1"><a href="#cite_note-salon-20" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 20;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[20]</span></a></span></p>

<p>Metabolife, makers of the best-selling brand of ephedra supplement, had received over 14,000 complaints of adverse events associated with its product. These reports were not initially provided to the FDA.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-consumerreports_26-1"><a href="#cite_note-consumerreports-26" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 26;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[26]</span></a></span><span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-27"><a href="#cite_note-27" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 27;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[27]</span></a></span> Co-founder of Metabolife, Michael Ellis, was sentenced in 2008 to six months in federal prison for his failure to report adverse effects from his company's products to the FDA.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-28"><a href="#cite_note-28" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 28;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[28]</span></a></span> Senators Orrin Hatch (R. Utah) and Tom Harkin (D. Iowa), authors of the Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act, questioned the scientific basis for the FDA's proposed labeling changes and suggested that the number of problems reported were insufficient to warrant regulatory action. At the time, Senator Hatch's son was working for a firm hired to lobby Congress and the FDA on behalf of ephedra manufacturers.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-latimes_29-0"><a href="#cite_note-latimes-29" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 29;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[29]</span></a></span></p>

<p>In addition to the activities of the Ephedra Education Council, Metabolife spent more than $4 million between 1998 and 2000 lobbying against state regulation of ephedra in Texas.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-sciencewolfe_30-0"><a href="#cite_note-sciencewolfe-30" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 30;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[30]</span></a></span> <i>Business Week</i> reported that efforts to regulate ephedra and other potentially harmful supplements had been "beaten down by deep-pocketed industry lobbying."<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-bw_31-0"><a href="#cite_note-bw-31" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 31;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[31]</span></a></span></p>

<p>Steve Bechler, a pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles, died of complications from heatstroke following a spring training workout on February 17, 2003.

According to Bruce Silverglade, legal director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, "All of a sudden [after Bechler's death] Congress dropped objections to an ephedra ban and started demanding that the FDA act."<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-consumerreports_26-3"><a href="#cite_note-consumerreports-26" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 26;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[26]</span></a></span></p>

<p>Senator Orrin Hatch (R.

<p>In response to renewed calls for the regulation of ephedra, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services commissioned a large meta-analysis of ephedra's safety and efficacy by the RAND Corporation. This study found that ephedra promoted modest short-term weight loss, but there was insufficient data to determine whether it was effective for long-term weight loss or performance enhancement. The use of ephedrine alkaloids in this study was associated with significant gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and autonomic side effects.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-rand_36-0"><a href="#cite_note-rand-36" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 36;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[36]</span></a></span> Almost simultaneously, a study in <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i> found that ephedrine alkaloids were 100 to 700 times more likely to cause a significant adverse reaction than other commonly used supplements such as <a href="Kava.htm" tppabs="https://ptable.com/wiki/compounds/A/Kava" title="Kava">kava</a> or <i>Ginkgo biloba</i>.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-Bent_2003_6-1"><a href="#cite_note-Bent_2003-6" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 6;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[6]</span></a></span></p>

<p>Nutraceutical Corporation, a supplement manufacturer based in Park City, Utah, challenged the legality of the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids as exceeding the authority given the agency by the Dietary Health Supplements and Education Act. Nutraceutical Corporation stated that while they did not intend to restart marketing ephedra, they were concerned about the scope of the FDA's regulatory action. Judge Tena Campbell of the Utah Federal District Court ruled that the FDA had not proven that low doses of ephedra alkaloids were unsafe, although she also noted that studies to address the safety of low-dose ephedra would be unethical. Nevertheless, her ruling overturned the ban on the sale of ephedra alkaloids in the state of Utah, and called into question whether the ban could be enforced anywhere in the United States.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-nytimes_38-0"><a href="#cite_note-nytimes-38" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 38;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[38]</span></a></span></p>

<p>The ruling was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver, Colorado. On August 17, 2006, the Appeals Court upheld the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids, finding that the 133,000 page administrative record compiled by the FDA supported the agency's finding that ephedra alkaloids posed an unreasonable risk to consumers.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-fdaappeal_10-1"><a href="#cite_note-fdaappeal-10" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 10;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[10]</span></a></span> Nutraceutical Corp. filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking a rehearing on the ban of ephedra alkaloids; however, on May 14, 2007 the United States Supreme Court declined to hear this petition.

<p>It was only two hundred and fifty years ago when western scholars first encountered the Vedas, but these ancient religious texts had been written down around 1500 B.C. and likely existed orally long before that.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-:1_43-0"><a href="#cite_note-:1-43" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 43;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[43]</span></a></span>  Throughout the many hymns, prayers, and philosophy found in its pages, a mysterious plant is mentioned often and with great reverence. This plant alternates from a holy substance to an actual personified god and is considered a teacher, doctor, medicine, a bringer of insight and a vector of inspiration.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-:2_44-0"><a href="#cite_note-:2-44" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 44;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[44]</span></a></span> &nbsp;The deity version of Soma was associated with medicinal herbs and the moon and was considered a &nbsp;bringer of health and prosperity.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-45"><a href="#cite_note-45" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 45;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[45]</span></a></span> &nbsp;The plant was an essential aspect of Vedic religion to alter one’s mind, enabling communion with the divine. The ritual drinking of Soma was also found in the ancient Zoroastrian text, the Avesta.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-:2_44-1"><a href="#cite_note-:2-44" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 44;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[44]</span></a></span> &nbsp;The rituals and importance of the plant were very similar to those in Vedic culture but were instead called by the name <i>haoma</i>.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-:2_44-2"><a href="#cite_note-:2-44" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 44;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[44]</span></a></span> &nbsp;It is unknown why, but eventually in both the Vedic and Zoroastrian cultures a substitute substance was used in these religious ceremonies and over time the definitive identity of Soma-Haoma has been lost. &nbsp;There is much debate over which species is the sacred plant but the most evidence and support from experts in the field show that the identity of Soma was a species of Ephedra.</p>

<p>In Hinduism, the Vedic texts show Soma as being not only a plant but also a drink and a deity. The Rigveda is one of the four oldest and most sacred collections of stories in Hinduism. In the Rigveda soma is a drink consumed by two of the main gods; Agni and Indra. In the texts the drink helped the gods in battle by strengthening them physically.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-46"><a href="#cite_note-46" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 46;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[46]</span></a></span> Because of this, soma was given and consumed by warriors before wartime or a battle. The drink was supposed to give the warriors strength and luck in the upcoming conflict.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-:1_43-1"><a href="#cite_note-:1-43" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 43;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[43]</span></a></span> Immortality is also a quality associated with soma due to it being a drink of the divine. At religious ceremonies the drink was consumed to give consumers longevity in life. At birth the drink was also given to the babies for these same reasons.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-:1_43-2"><a href="#cite_note-:1-43" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 43;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[43]</span></a></span></p> 

<p>In Zoroastrianism the drink is called haoma and has similar uses. Just like in Hinduism, the drink was related to immortality and long life. Haoma was the first thing newborns drank. This assured the child would be healthy and live a long life.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-:1_43-3"><a href="#cite_note-:1-43" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 43;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[43]</span></a></span> The drink was also administered to people close to death to resurrect them back into good health.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-:1_43-4"><a href="#cite_note-:1-43" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 43;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[43]</span></a></span></p>

    <summary class="section-heading"><h3 id="Evidence_of_Ephedra_as_the_identity_of_Soma">Evidence of Ephedra as the identity of Soma</h3></summary>
    
<p>Out of the possible identities of Soma one of the main theories is that it is a plant from the Ephedra genus, more specifically Ephedra sinica. Soma and haoma are considered by most to be very similar if not the same drink just with different names due to their differences in religious backgrounds. Both in modern Zoroastrianism and past scriptures the main ingredient of haoma has been plants of the Ephedra genus.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-:1_43-5"><a href="#cite_note-:1-43" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 43;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[43]</span></a></span> This suggests that its close counterpart soma is also made from the Ephedra plants.</p>

<p>Another reason Ephedra sinica is believed to be the main ingredient in the original soma drink is because of its effects on the body. The genus of plants contains the phytochemical ephedrine. The stimulant increases heart rate as well as blood pressure. It dilates the user's pupils and also relaxes non-essential muscles.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-:3_47-0"><a href="#cite_note-:3-47" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 47;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[47]</span></a></span> The drink was given to men before battle and was said to increase their strength and effectiveness on the battlefield. All of these effects of ephedrine would suggest why warriors would feel stronger or more effective on the battlefield. Ephedra would make sense as the ingredient in soma due to its stimulant qualities.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-:3_47-1"><a href="#cite_note-:3-47" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 47;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[47]</span></a></span> Just like someone today who uses the ephedrine for blood pressure or asthma medication, someone back then who consumed the plant would feel strengthened by it. The effects of soma in the texts are described as that of a stimulant. An example of this is causing people to stay awake throughout the nighttime.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-:2_44-3"><a href="#cite_note-:2-44" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 44;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[44]</span></a></span> &nbsp;In no way are the effects described as a depressant or hallucinogen. This points to ephedra as being a strong candidate for soma.</p>

<p>The physical appearance of Ephedra is also a reason it is believed to be the soma plant. According to the Vedic text Rigveda, the plant composing soma is shaped like an arrow. Ephedra sinica is a gymnosperm that forms stalks with buds on the end. It is easy to see how this shape could be described like an arrow.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-:1_43-6"><a href="#cite_note-:1-43" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 43;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[43]</span></a></span> Another text refers to soma as a twig, which is much like Ephedra sinica when it is dried out.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-:2_44-4"><a href="#cite_note-:2-44" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 44;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[44]</span></a></span>
